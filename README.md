This is the software of a puzzle I have created, similar to Rubik's cube but kind of different. You can freely copy, add, distribute, etc. To know more, read the MIT licence terms.
**You can play the puzzle on Windows by downloading "Sphere.zip" in the download section.** After extracting the contents, run the file sphere.exe.
